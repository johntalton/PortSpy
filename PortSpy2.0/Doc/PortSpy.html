<img src="img/Spy.gif">Portspy is a simple utility. It basic funtions are to scan network ports on a computer. It was writen becase I have severl computer behind 
a firewall and I needed to test some 'stuff'.  PortSpy have been a long time on development and has many features that make it feal like a BeOS program.
PortSpy is higly multi-threaded and can be used while a Scan, DNS lookup, Ping etc... is going on. The GUI stays responsive and most of the tools alow you to
cancel out.  This is mainly because we are useing YTabView which plays well with threads and give you the ability to switch tabs while working and still update the attached view.<br>

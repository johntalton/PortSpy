<img src="img/Spy.gif">Simple but quite usefull DNS tool. DNS let you look up information about a IP address or about a server name. It returns to you lots of usefull things like any aliases and any other IP address assigned to that name.  This is most usefull - I find - when I get a hit from on my webserver from a IP and I want to figure out who it is. I just type there IP in and hit 'Lookup' and it returns me the host they came from. This is a verry simular function as nslookup command under unix.<br>

<br>
DNS has two way of looking up hosts. One by IP and the other by Name. Just choose which method you want and type in the name/ip and hit lookup. The information will be droped to the box. Here is a lookup by name on www.yahoo.com<br>

Here we do a look up by IP. Notice the alias field .. lots of usefull infomation here :P<br>
